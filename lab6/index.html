    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      One of the first challenges we faced was trying to actually figure out on how to start on the lab. Trying to see how everything would actually function properly without getting an error message.
    </p>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>
			Some problems we did face was seeing the instructions since It seemed the screenshot was misplaced. As well as, try to see how the JavaScript would flow on the browser without getting an error message.

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>
      We have successfully completed lab 6 with a functioning script output.

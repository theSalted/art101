    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      We gladly didnâ€™t face many challenges for this lab. It was quite simple
      thanks to the previous experiments we did during the lecture. As well as,
      looking back at some lecture notes along with screenshots really helped us
      to understand this lab more effectively.

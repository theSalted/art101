    <h1>LAB3 FILE STRUCTURES</h1>
    <p>
      FOR LAB3 WE MODIFIED OUR FILE STRUCTURE SO IT MET REQUIREMENTS, AND WE
      MADE ADD AN SITE INDEX ON OUR MAIN INDEX.HTML. WE UPLOADED A PICTURE OF
      OURSELVES TO OUR OWN GIT REPOSITORY AND WE LINKED THE PICTURE TO
      INDEX.HTML AS WELL. AND BELOW ARE SOME CHALLENGES WE MET DURING THIS
      PROCESS AND A SCREENSHOT OF FILE STRUCTURE MENTIONED ABOVE.
    </p>
    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
    <p>
      WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY DIFFICULTIES AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR LAB. WE HAD
      TRIED TO CONNECT OUR GITHUB AND/OR ATOMS BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT WOULDN'T
      ALLOW US DUE TO SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH BOTH OF OUR LAPTOPS
      RUNNING INTO COMPLICATIONS. EITHER INTERNET CONNECTION OR LAPTOPS HAVING
      TROUBLESHOOTS. HOWEVER, WE GOT THE HANG OF IT AND TRIED TO FOLLOW THE
      STEPS MORE EFFICIENTLY ON LAB 3 ON CANVAS. IN THE END, WE FOUND OUR WAY
      AROUND WITH GITHUB AND WERE ABLE TO WORK ON THE LAB MORE EFFECTIVELY.
    </p>
    <h2>RESULT</h2>
